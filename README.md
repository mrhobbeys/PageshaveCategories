Add Category to Pages.

== Description ==
This plugin will add a category option to your pages. This is it\'s most simple form right now. I will try to add more options as it becomes apparent they are needed like possibly if extra code is needed to add to custom post types (custom page types)  or an admin panel to turn it on and off for other page types.

Enjoy

== Installation ==
Download the zip and use WordPress to upload and install the zip. 

Optionally download the zip and unzip it then upload the files to your WP-Content via FTP.

Preferred search for the plugin in the Add New Plugin section of your website and install it automattically.
